<br>
<img border="0" src="img/hardware/icons.png"><br>
<br>
2.  Hovering over the icon will show you the volume currently set, If you left click it will toggle mute and unmute for the Master volume.
<br>
<br>
<img border="0" src="img/hardware/audio2.png"><br>
<br>
3. Right clicking on the sound Icon will bring you a menu with a few options, you can select Properties to adjust a few options.<br>
<br>
<img border="0" src="img/hardware/audio3.png"><br>
<br>
4. You can select Sound card, Mixer, and what command the Left click uses. 
Generally You will not need to adjust any of the settings aside from selecting Sound card.<br>
<br>
<img border="0" src="img/hardware/audio4.png"><br>
</p>

<p>
5. If your unable to hear any sound, you would need to check the audio settings with alsamixer.<br>
<br>
Type the following into a Terminal window. (Located under the Accessories section of the Menu.)<br>
<table border="0" width="800" bgcolor="#FFFF55">
<tr>
<td><b>alsamixer</b></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>
<br>
<img border="0" src="img/hardware/audio1.png"><br><br>
6. If your sound card doesn&#39;t appear to be the default, You can toggle this by selecting the proper card and pressing F6.<br><br>
7. You have a few choices of what to view, Playback (pressing F3) and Capture (Pressing F4). For our 
purposes you'll be pressing the F3 key and looking at master, or any other choices focusing on the lower part of the meters. You'll want to see OO if it displays MM your device and muted, to toggle this press the m key. To adjust sound levels in this case you simple press the up and down keys accordingly. This method can be used for both out going audio and incoming. For example some people need to 
manually adjust volume for a microphone to do this press F4. You can then toggle mute and adjust volume for your needs.<br>

<font size="4"><b><a name="report"></a>Create System Report tool</b></font></p>
				<p>

The Create System Report tool was created to better help people who experienced 
a problem with their computer. The report contains useful information about the 
hardware, network and software. The idea of the tool is to run it, then you 
would attach it to a Forum thread with a title about the issue you are having. 
Lets get started.</p>
				<p>

Click on <b>Menu, System, Create System Report</b>.</p>
				<p>

<img border="0" src="img/hardware/systemreport1.png"></p>
				<p>

A terminal will pop open, read the information in the window and enter your 
password when ready.</p>
				<p>

<img border="0" src="img/hardware/systemreport2.png"></p>
				<p>

The report will take anywhere from a few seconds to less than a minute depending 
on your hardware.<br>
When it is finished you will see a screen like below.</p>
				<p>

<img border="0" src="img/hardware/systemreport3.png"></p>
				<p>

You can see that it says, &#39;<b>You now have a file called 
systeminfo-Friday-17-May-2013-23:41:10.txt in your Home folder.</b>&#39;</p>
				<p>

Here is the file:</p>
