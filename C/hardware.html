				<p>The next step is to go to <b>Menu, System, Install Drivers</b>.</p>
				<p><img border="0" src="img/hardware/ati2.png"></p>
				<p>You will be asked to enter your password.</p>
				<p><img border="0" src="img/hardware/ati3.png"></p>
				<p>The program will then scan your computer for any drivers that

The Create System Report tool was created to better help people who experienced 
a problem with their computer. The report contains useful information about the 
hardware, network and software. The idea of the tool is to run it, then you 
would attach the generated file to a Forum thread with a title about the issue you are having. 
Lets get started.</p>
				<p>

Click on <b>Menu, System, Create System Report</b>.</p>
				<p>

<img border="0" src="img/hardware/systemreport1.png"></p>

A terminal will pop open, read the information in the window and enter your 
password when ready.</p>
				<p>

<img border="0" src="img/hardware/systemreport2.png"></p>
				<p>

The report will take anywhere from a few seconds to less than a minute depending 
on your hardware.<br>
When it is finished you will see a screen like below.</p>
				<p>

<img border="0" src="img/hardware/systemreport3.png"></p>
				<p>

You can see that it says, &#39;<b>You now have a file called
