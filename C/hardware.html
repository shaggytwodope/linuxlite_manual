</p>

<p>
5. If your unable to hear any sound, you would need to check the audio settings with alsamixer.<br>
<br>
Type the following into a Terminal window. (Located under the Accessories section of the Menu.)<br>
<table border="0" width="800" bgcolor="#FFFF55">
<tr>
<td><b>alsamixer</b></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>
<br>
<img border="0" src="img/hardware/audio1.png"><br><br>
6. If your sound card doesn&#39;t appear to be the default, You can toggle this by selecting the proper card and pressing F6.<br><br>
7. You have a few choices of what to view, Playback (pressing F3) and Capture (Pressing F4). For our 
purposes you'll be pressing the F3 key and looking at master, or any other choices focusing on the lower part of the meters. You'll want to see OO if it displays MM your device and muted, to toggle this press the m key. To adjust sound levels in this case you simple press the up and down keys accordingly. This method can be used for both out going audio and incoming. For example some people need to 
manually adjust volume for a microphone to do this press F4. You can then toggle mute and adjust volume for your needs.<br>
