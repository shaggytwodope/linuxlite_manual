				<p><b><font size="4">Installing Software:</font></b></p>
				<p>Linux Lite uses the Synaptic Package Manager to install 
				software.</p>
				<p>To install software use the following steps:</p>
				<p>1. Click on <b>Menu</b>, <b>System</b>, <b>Install/Remove 
				Software</b></p>
				<p>
				<img border="1" src="img/menu_synaptic.png"></p>
				<p>2. Make sure <b>All</b> is selected in the left pane and in the <b>Quick Filter</b> box, type in your search query. In 
				this example we will search for the &#39;<b>audacious</b>&#39; music 
				player.</p>
				<p>
				<img border="1" src="img/synaptic_search.png"></p>
				<p>3. Double click on the package you want to install.</p>
				<p>4. Some software will ask you to <b>Mark additional required 
				changes?</b> These are also known as dependencies and are 
				required for the program to function properly.</p>
				<p>
				<img border="0" src="img/synaptic_deps.png"></p>
				<p>5. Click on <b>Mark</b>. Now hit the <b>Apply</b> button on 
				the Synaptic toolbar. The software will install and a <b>Menu</b> 
				entry will be created in the relevant <b>Menu</b> category. For 
				<b>audacious</b> 
				the <b>Menu</b> category would be <b>Multimedia</b>.</p>
				<p>
				<img border="1" src="img/synaptic_apply.png"></p>
				<p>6. Go to the <b>Menu</b> and your new software will be there. 
				An alternative way to find your new software is to click on <b>
				Menu</b>, <b>Accessories</b>, <b>Application Finder</b>. Type 
				your program name in the <b>Search</b> box and the result will 
				display on the right. Double click on the program name and it 
				will launch for you.</p>
				<p>
				<img border="0" src="img/app_finder.png"></p>
				<p><b>Uninstalling Software:</b></p>
				<p>7.<b> </b>Uninstalling software is the reverse process of 
				installing software in the <b>Synaptic Package Manager</b>. Type 
				the name of the software into the <b>Search</b> box.</p>
				<p>8. Right click on the software and select <b>Mark for Removal</b>. 
				Now hit the <b>Apply</b> button on the Synaptic toolbar and your 
				software will uninstall. Be very careful with this process as 
				you can inadvertently uninstall crucial system software. If you 
				have any doubts, please search the net first to see if it is 
				safe to uninstall the software. Synaptic is pretty good at 
				warning you should there be any potential problems.</p><hr>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p><b><a name="updates"><font size="4">Updates</font></a><font size="4">:</font></b></p>
				<p>Keeping Linux Lite up to date is a simple process.</p>
				<p>At the top of your <b>Menu</b>, you will see <b>Install 
				Updates</b>.</p>
				<p>
				<img border="0" src="img/menu_updates.png"></p>
				<p>We&#39;ve made the update process as simple as possible. Simply 
				click on <b>Install Updates</b> and you will be asked for your 
				password. The program will then search for updates and if it 
				finds any it will ask you if you want to continue. Type <b>Y</b> 
				and then hit enter if you do and the when the updates have 
				finished the window will close automatically.</p><hr>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p><b><font size="4"><a name="sources"><a/>Change your Software Updates Country 
				Location</font></b></p>
				<a/>
				<p>To ensure that you get your updates and software downloaded 
				as fast as possible, try selecting a location close to you.<br>
				In the following tutorial we will show you how to do this.</p>
				<p>Click on <b>Menu, System, Install/Remove Software</b> and 
				enter your password.</p></a>
				<p><img border="0" src="img/sources-password.png"></p>
				<p><b>Synaptic Package Manager</b> will open up, click on <b>
				Settings, Repositories</b>.</p>
				<p><img border="1" src="img/sources-repos.png"></p>
				<p>The <b>Software Sources</b> window will pop up. From the <b>
				Download from:</b> drop down box, select <b>Other...</b></p>
				<p><img border="0" src="img/sources-other.png"></p>
				<p>A <b>Choose a Download Server</b> box will pop up. From here 
				select your country, and then a server, preferably an Ubuntu 
				server if it is listed or another server if an Ubuntu server is 
				not in the list. Click on the <b>Choose Server</b> button once 
				you have made your selection. Now click on <b>Close</b> in the
				<b>Software Sources</b> window.</p>
				<p><img border="0" src="img/sources-country.png"></p>
				<p>In the top left of the <b>Synaptic Package Manager</b> 
				window, click on the <b>Reload</b> button. This will change all 
				the software sources to your location for faster downloads.</p>
				<p><img border="1" src="img/sources-reload.png"></p>
				<p>The following window will appear, then close when it has 
				finished.</p>
				<p><img border="0" src="img/sources-reload2.png"></p>
				<p>You should now have faster downloads for updates and software 
				installs in <b>Synaptic Package Manager</b> from a location much 
				nearer you.</p><a/><hr>

				<b><font size="4"><a name="deskenv">Changing Desktop Environments:</font></a></b></p>
				<p>
				This distro is a heavily modified version of the XFCE desktop 
				environment. However, being GNU/Linux based allows people the 
				freedom to modify their system as they see fit. There are 
				numerous desktop environments in GNU/Linux. Including but not 
				limited to:</p>
				<p>
				Gnome<br>
				KDE<br>
				LXDE<br>
				Enlightenment<br>
				Razor-qt</p>
				<p>
				If you desire to install another desktop environment, we cannot 
				provide specific instructions on how to do this. There are far 
				to many variables involved and much can go wrong. This kind of 
				system modification is best left to experienced Linux users. The 
				whole philosophy behind Linux Lite is to provide new users to 
				Linux based operating systems an easy to use, functional desktop 
				experience. Our development time is spent solely on the XFCE end 
				user experience.</p>
