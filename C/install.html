				Be very careful to make sure you choose the right drive letter, 
				as you can see in the <b>Filesystem</b> column, my device is<b> 
				sdb</b> another clue is the value in the <b>Size </b>column, here it
				is shown as <b>15G</b>. In this example my device is an Apacer <b>
				15gb</b> USB stick.<p>
				<img border="0" src="img/installer/df-h.png"><p>
				<br>
				Open a folder and make sure you are in the directory that the

				</b></font><br>
				Start your computer, and go into your system Bios and check 
				that the boot order is set so that DVD and USB devices are set 
				to boot first. This varies from bios to bios. Refer to your 
				motherboard documentation for more information.<br>
				Once you are happy with your bios set up, insert the DVD disc or 
				USB stick into your computer and reboot your computer. You&#39;ll 
				be greeted with the following screen.<p>
				<img border="0" src="img/installer/bootmenu.png"><p>
				In most cases you&#39;ll want to choose <b>Live</b>. This is also a good 
				way to check that all of your hardware is supported.<p>
				The other options are:<p>
				<b>Safe Mode</b> - If you are having trouble booting the <b>Live</b> 
				option, try this instead.<br>
				<b>Install</b> - Begin the install process immediately.<br>
				<b>Terminal</b> - This will boot up the computer in text mode, 
				showing you each of the processes as they run.<br>
				<b>Debug Mode</b> - Similar to the <b>Terminal</b> option.<br>
				<b>Memtest</b> - Test your computer memory for faults.<br>
				<b>HDD</b> - Boot the from the first hard disk.<p>
				<b>NOTE: If you are having any trouble booting the Live DVD/USB, 
				please read through <a href="hardware.html#booting">this trouble 
				shooting guide</a>.<br>
				</b><br>
				The computer will go through the boot up process, this may take 
				anywhere from a few seconds to a couple of minutes depending on 
				your hardware. The login for the Live user is automatic, there 
				is no need to login. An explanation of the various Menu&#39;s can be 
				found by clicking <a href="index.html#menus">here</a>.<p>
				Once you&#39;ve had a look around Linux Lite and are ready to 
				install the first step is to double click on the <b>Install Linux Lite</b> 
				icon on your Desktop.
				<p><img src="img/installer/installicon.png" alt="" />
              <p>                
              <p>The installer will then open on the desktop and display the Welcome section of the installer. From here you will select your preferred language and view release notes for this version of Linux Lite.
              <p>              
	            <p><img src="img/installer/1-language.png" alt="" />
	            <p>
	            <p>After selecting continue, you are presented with some requirements for the installation. Ensure that these requirements are met by viewing a check mark beside them. You may also choose to download any available updates while installing or install third-party software during the installation. NOTE: Please verify the legal status of the use of the third party software in your country/territory.
	            <p>
	            <p><img src="img/installer/2-prepare.png" alt="" />                                                
	            <p>
	            <p>Now it is time to choose the method of installing Linux Lite to your hard disk. You will have several options during this phase of the installer. You may choose to erase the entire disk and install Linux Lite, if you are running a version of Windows you may be presented with the options of installing Linux Lite over 
				Windows or installing it alongside Windows. If these options do not facilitate your needs, there is a manual partitioning option labeled Something Else.
	            <p>
	            <p><img src="img/installer/3-selectinstall.png" alt="" />                                                
	            <p>
	            <p><strong>Erase Disk and Install Linux</strong>                
	            <p>
	            <p>Upon selecting Erase Disk and Install Linux you are presented with a screen displaying how your install will be represented on the hard disk. This is the most simple option available and will show your hard disk being completely and solely occupied by Linux Lite. You may select the disk you wish to install Linux Lite to from the menu 
				labeled: Select Drive. You may then select Install Now when you are ready to begin installing.
	            <p>
	            <p><img src="img/installer/3c-replaceinstall.png" alt="" />

	            <p><strong>Install Linux alongside Windows</strong>                
	            <p>
	            <p>If you have selected to install Linux Lite alongside an existing copy of Windows, you will be greeted with a screen representing the two operating systems on the disk. You may choose the disk to install Linux Lite to from the top menu labeled: Select Drive. In the main part of the window you will see your hard disk split into two sections, one containing your Windows install and one for your proposed Linux Lite installation. You may drag the empty space between them to allocate space from one to the other as needed. You may then select Install Now after you have made the desired changes.
	            <p>
	            <p><img src="img/installer/3b-installalong.png" alt="" />                                                
	            <p>
	            <p><strong>Something Else  !! ADVANCED USERS ONLY !!</strong>                
	            <p>
	            <p>If the other methods do not fulfill your personal requirements for installation you may select Something Else and manually partition your hard disk. There are many options available from this screen. All of your disks will be visible in a hierarchal tree view in the main window. From here you can see disk devices, existing partitions, and unallocated space. If your disk is new or you are creating a new install in a virtual machine you may need to select New Partition Table from the options below. This will erase the disk and provide you with a clean slate. <strong>WARNING</strong>: This will destroy any data on the disk selected! Another option is to add a partition to the disk by selecting Add from the button options. This option requires that there exists free space on the disk with which to create the partition. When adding a partition, you may select the place on the disk to create the partition, the partition size, the filesystem type, and the point in the filesystem that this partition will be mounted. If you need to modify these attributes of a partition, you may select Change from the button options. If there exists partitions that you wish to be rid of, you can select Delete from the button options to delete the partition. If you wish to return everything back to its original state you may use the Revert button. <strong>NOTE</strong>: This will only work if you have not written changes to the disk!
                <p>
                <p>Under the partitioner there is a menu for selecting the location of the boot loader's installation. You may select a drive's MBR, indicated by the device name e.g. /dev/sda, or you may select a partition to install the boot loader to. The safest option is to install the bootloader to the MBR of the first disk as the bootloader will intelligently add 
				entries for installations of Windows and other Linux installs.
                <p>

              <p>              
              <p>After completing the partitioning phase of the installation, you are prompted to set up some personal details about the system. The installer will continue to work in the background while you are filling out this information. The first step is to select your time zone. The installer may detect your time zone based on your location via your ISP's information. If not, you may select your time zone by either clicking on your region on the supplied map or by typing in your area in the box below.

              <p>              
              <p>The next step is to select your keyboard language and layout. You may select the language that your keyboard corresponds to on the left and any specialized layout on the right. This is the point where you may select to enable international keys on your keyboard. Though, these options may be changed later.

              <p>              
              <p>On the next screen, you are greeted by several forms to fill. These forms include your personal name, the name that you wish to use to identify the computer on your network, your user name that is used to login to the system, and your password that you wish to use for your user and root password. When creating a password, it is the best practice to use a complex and lengthy password, though one you can still remember. There are also options to enable auto-login for your user or have the computer prompt you for a password everytime you login. Finally, there is a selection for encrypting your user's Home folder for extra security.

              <p>After finishing all of these steps you will be greeted with a slideshow detailing all of the features and software that are included in this version of Linux Lite. You may allow them to play on their own or navigate through them using the arrow buttons on the sides of the window.

				<b>cp</b> - copy file to another directory<p>
				<b>rm</b> - remove a file or directory<p>

				this once.) This is where we will copy the new theme to.</p>
				<p><img border="1" src="img/installer/themes4.png"></p>
				<p>Download a theme of your choosing. In this example we will

				<p><b><font size="4">Applying a new Icon set</font></b></p>
				<p>Head over to the

				website and choose an
				<a target="_blank" href="http://gnome-look.org/index.php?xcontentmode=121">
				Icon set</a> of your liking.</p>
				<p><b>NOTE: Not all icon sets from there will work as you would 
				expect, please read all of the documentation before attempting 
				to apply a new icon set. Some make installation easy via a PPA, 
				this is a preferable method to the one shown here. Click

				The first thing we need to do is open up our home folder. Click

				Right click somewhere in your home folder, <b>Create Folder</b>, 
				make a folder called <b>.icons </b>(you will only need to do

				<p><img border="1" src="img/installer/icons1.png"></p>
				<p>Download an icon set of your choosing. In this example we will 
				choose the 
				<a target="_blank" href="http://gnome-look.org/content/show.php/Clarity?content=135654">
				Clarity Icon Set</a>.</p>
				<p><b>NOTE: Each icon theme may come with a specific set of 
				install instructions, if they do, please follow those 
				instructions.</b></p>
				<p>Next extract the icon set you just downloaded (right click,
				<b>Extract Here</b>)</p>
				<p><img border="1" src="img/installer/icons2.png"></p>
				<p>Copy the icon set folder to the <b>.icons</b> folder in your 
				home folder.</p>
				<p><img border="1" src="img/installer/icons3.png"></p>
				<p>Now got to <b>Menu, Settings, Appearance</b>. Select the <b>
				Icons</b> tab and click on your new Icon set.</p>
