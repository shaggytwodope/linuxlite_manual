				<p>In the system tray (near the clock, bottom right hand side of 
				your screen) if you have no connection at the moment you will 
				see a diagonal broken line with a red cross next to it. This denotes 
				that there is no connection currently. Left click on the icon, 
				if your wireless is working, you should have a list of wireless 
				networks in your area, select your network. If you cannot see 
				any wireless networks at all, your wireless device driver may 
				not be installed, or for example your wireless switch on your 
				laptop is in the Off position. If after you have checked this 
				there are still no wireless networks showing, go to <b>Menu, Settings, 
				Install Drivers</b> and see if your wireless device is listed. 
				If it is, install the driver for it and continue with this 
				tutorial. If it is not listed, click 
				<a href="hardware.html#wirelessdev">here</a> to troubleshoot your device.</p>
				<p>
				<img border="0" src="img/wireless-1.png"></p>
				<p>A box will pop up asking for your wireless password. If you 
				would like to view your password while you type it, tick the &#39;<b>Show 
				password</b>&#39; box to ensure that you have entered your wireless 
				password correctly.</p>
				<p>
				<img border="0" src="img/wireless-2.png"></p>
				<p>After a successful connection, you should see a tray icon 
				like the one shown below with 4 bars in total. The signal strength is 
				displayed by the number of bars. The more bars in bold, the stronger the 
				signal. In this example we are connected with 3 out of the 4 
				bars.</p>

				<p>Assuming you have already set up shares on your Windows 
				computer, please read through the following guide.<br>
				Accessing your existing Windows shares is simple. First step, we 
				need to set up your Linux Lite shares.</p>
				<p>Create a folder in your home folder and place into it files 
				that you want to share with your Windows computer.</p>
				<p>Right click on your home folder, <b>Create Folder</b>. Now 
				give your new folder a name, in this example we&#39;ll use the name &#39;<b>share</b>&#39;.</p>
				<p>Now click on <b>Menu, System, Network Share Settings, Edit 
				Network Shares</b>, and 
				follow very carefully the onscreen instructions. Do not miss any 
				steps and take your time. A text editor will pop up with content 
				similar to that of the example below. Only change the text that 
				is in <b>bold</b>.</p>
				<table border="0" width="800" id="table1" bgcolor="#FFFF55">
					<tr>
						<td>#======================= Global Settings 
						====================================<br>
				[global]<br>
				workgroup = <b>WORKGROUP</b><br>
				server string = Linux Lite Shares<br>
				netbios name = $HOSTNAME<br>
				security = user<br>
				map to guest = bad user<br>
				dns proxy = no<br>
						#======================= Share Definitions 
				===================================<br>
				[linuxliteshare]<br>
				path = /home/$USER/<b>share</b><br>
				browsable = yes<br>
				writable = yes<br>
				guest ok = yes<br>
				read only = no</td>
					</tr>
				</table>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p><b>There is no need to change any of the other settings. 
				Doing so may cause the shares not to work.<br>
				</b>You only need to change:</p>
				<table border="0" width="800" id="table3" bgcolor="#FFFF55">
					<tr>
						<td><b>WORKGROUP - </b>Change this to the workgroup name 
						of your Windows computer.<b><br>
						</b>path = /home/$USER/<b>share</b> - change <b>share</b> 
						to the name of the folder you created earlier.</td>
					</tr>
				</table>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>Save and Close the file.<br>
				<br>
				Now that everything is set up, click on <b>Menu, System, Network 
				Share Settings, Restart Network Share Services</b>.</p>
				<table border="0" width="800" id="table4" bgcolor="#FFFF55">
					<tr>
						<td><b>NOTE: Anytime that you modify your share settings 
						you must click on Restart Network Share Services for the 
						changes to apply.</b></td>
					</tr>
				</table>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>If at any stage you want to add more share folders, you can 
				simply add more blocks like in the example below:</p>
				<table border="0" width="800" id="table5" bgcolor="#FFFF55">
					<tr>
						<td>#======================= Global Settings 
						====================================<br>
						[global]<br>
						workgroup = <b>WORKGROUP</b><br>
						server string = Linux Lite Shares<br>
						netbios name = $HOSTNAME<br>
						security = user<br>
						map to guest = bad user<br>
						dns proxy = no<br>
						#======================= Share Definitions 
						===================================<br>
						[linuxliteshare]<br>
						path = /home/$USER/<b>share</b><br>
						browsable = yes<br>
						writable = yes<br>
						guest ok = yes<br>
						read only = no<br>
						<br>
						[linuxlitesharevideos]<br>
						path = /home/$USER/<b>Videos</b><br>
						browsable = yes<br>
						writable = yes<br>
						guest ok = yes<br>
						read only = no<br>
						<br>
						[linuxlitesharedocuments]<br>
						path = /home/$USER/<b>Documents</b><br>
						browsable = yes<br>
						writable = yes<br>
						guest ok = yes<br>
						read only = no</td>
					</tr>
				</table>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>Don&#39;t forget to do <b>Menu, System, Network 
				Share Settings, Restart Network Share Services</b> to apply the 
				new share settings.</p>
				<p>Go to your Windows machine and find the ip address. To do 
				this, open a command prompt and type in <b>ipconfig</b>.</p>
				<p>
				<img border="0" src="img/win_ipconfig.png"></p>
				<p>Usually the results at the top has your ip address listed. In 
				the above example, the ip address is: <b>192.168.0.66<br>
				</b>Make a note of this ip address.</p>
				<p>Now go back to your Linux Lite computer, and open your home 
				folder.</p>
				<table border="0" width="800" id="table2" bgcolor="#FFFF55">
					<tr>
						<td><b>NOTE: If by the end of this Shares tutorial you 
						are still not seeing any shares, try restarting both 
						machines.<br>
						Sometimes it can take a while before the share appears.</b></td>
					</tr>
				</table>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>In the address bar, type in: <b>smb://ipaddressofwindowspc</b> 
				where <b>ipaddressofwindowspc</b> is the actual numbered ip 
				address of your Windows computer.</p>
				<p>
				<img border="0" src="img/smb_address_bar.png"></p>
				<p>If everything went to plan, you should now be prompted for 
				your Windows username, domain or workgroup and your Windows 
				password.</p>
				<p>
				<img border="0" src="img/smb_password.png"></p>
				<p>Now you can copy and paste files between computers in your 
				new <b>share</b> folder.</p>
				<p>
				<img border="0" src="img/smb_shares.png"></p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
